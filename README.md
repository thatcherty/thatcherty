### 🔍 About Me
I’m a junior studying **Computer Science** with minors in **Mathematics** and **Computer Systems Engineering**.  
I’m currently exploring how **AI, machine learning, and quantum computing** can make technology more adaptive, efficient, and meaningful for people.

I am currently a **Service Desk Manager** where I lead two technicians and help coordinate infrastructure projects—including a Windows 11 and Citrix upgrade.
These projects taught me a lot about system design, planning, and how technology impacts real users.
